Taglets Feeder is a Wordpress plug-in that announces your blog postings on Taglets.org when you publish a post.

== Description ==

Taglets Feeder is a Wordpress plug-in that announces your blog postings on Taglets.org when you publish a post.

For each tag you specify for the post in Wordpress during post creation, when you publish the post, Taglets Feeder sends a comment to those tags with a comment of the form: [post title] [short url]

You can optionally specify a tag that Taglets Feeder always sends to, for every post you publish (e.g. a tag for the name of your blog), in addition to the tags specified for the post.

== Installation ==

1. Extract taglets-feeder.zip to /wp-content/plugins/taglets-feeder/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Setup your fixed tag (if any) and other options on the options page.
